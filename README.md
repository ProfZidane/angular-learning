# Elearning LEA

This project is just a try of make application that communicate with Keycloak server and Spring boot API

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
But you need to download and run the keycloak server (https://www.keycloak.org/downloads.html) and also run the spring boot api (available on my github).
To run the keycloak, use : kc.bat start-dev (on windows) or kc.sh start-dev (on linux)
To run the spring boot api, use any editor (for me, it's intellij ;-) )
